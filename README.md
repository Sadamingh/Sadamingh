### Hi there! 

I am **[Yufeng Xing](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yufengxing/)** (pen name: Adam Edelweiss) 👋 I am currently a data science student at University of San Francisco. At the same time, I am also taking the OMSCS at Gatech as a supplement. I studyed Business in China at Sun Yat-sen University so I also have some business-side knowledge.

Aside of being a data science and computer science student, I am a,

- 📝 **Blogger**: I wrote articles about computer science and data science. Mainly sharing what I've learned at school. You can find them [here](https://serenefield.com/Blog/).
- ⛰ **Hiker**: I have travelled around Europe and China, but since I am still learning how to 🚗, I haven't got any chances to explore the national parks around US (0/63). 
- 🏊‍♂️ **Swimmer**: I was a swimming athlete but now I am gaining weights 🥳.
- 🎻 **Violinist**: I am thinking about composing some day. Maybe one day I can upload some of my music pieces that are still working in progress.
- 🎮 **Gamer**: I have something in my mind now and I am thinking about making a game in the future. I am a huge fan of Undertale ❤️, Arknights ♖, Sekiro 🗡, Horizon Zero Dawn 🤖, Splatoon 🦑, and DST 🍳.
- 📸 **Photographer**: See some of them [here](https://sadamingh.github.io/gallery.html), althougth I am kind of lazy to update.
- 🛠 **Hardware Enthusiast**: I am a fan of robots and electronic hardwares, but I have no backgrounds.

I work with data and softwares, but I enjoy designing as well. You can find my works here.
